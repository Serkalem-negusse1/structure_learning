# Structure Learning in Bayesian Networks

This project demonstrates structure learning in Bayesian Networks, based on Chapter 18 of *Probabilistic Graphical Models* by Koller & Friedman.

Includes:
- Constraint-based learning (PC Algorithm)
- Score-based learning (BIC, BDe)
- Structure search (Greedy, MCMC)
- Visualization
- Evaluation
